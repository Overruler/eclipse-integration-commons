Setting Up STS - GSG integration
================================

Note: the format of the web page in the new dashboard is very much
in flux, changing all the time. We know at the moment it looks a bit crappy.

1. Download and install STS 3.3.0.RELEASE from
   http://www.springsource.org/downloads/sts-ggts
   
2. Temporary: Edit STS.ini and add (at end):

-Dgithub.user.name=XXXXXXX
-Dgithub.user.password=XXXXXXX
-Dsts.new.dashboard.enabled=true
-Dspring.site.url=http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-Dspring.guides.url=http://XXXXXXXXXXXX/guides

In place of XXXX the following info must be added:
  - Use a username and password for a github user that
    is a *member* of *spring-guides* org.
  - The new spring website url (or its current temporary location)
  - A url pointing to the 'guides' page on the new spring website.

3. Install New STS Features from nightly update site

http://dist.springframework.org/snapshot/IDE/nightly/

Select all of 'Core / Spring IDE' and install.

4. If using Gradle. Install lates from nightly

http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/TOOLS/gradle/nightly

4. Restart STS
5. To get the new dashboard: close and reopen Dashboard 
   (if the old dashboard is still open).

Notes:
 - Browsing GSG content in the dashboard an extra link should
   appear underneath the 'Donwload Zip' button. 
   (Update: not currently working, open the import wizard from
   the main page (Import Guide button) or via the route
   'File >> Import >> Spring >> Getting Started Content'
 - The GSG import wizard now also opens if you click on the 
   'Spring Framework Guides' button on the main dashboard page.
 - If clicking link does not open the wizard. It means the
   particular content was not found. The most likely cause of
   this is incorrect github credentials. 
   Another cause may be the sagan pages are out of synch and
   displaying conten that can't be discovered on github 
   springsource.meta org.
 - 'Import' links only appear in Dashboard not the standard
   Eclipse 'Internal Web Browser'.
 - github credentials will not be needed anymore when the
   springsource.meta project become public accessible.

Linux Users only
================

On some linux platforms there are issues using the Eclipse 
embedded webbrowser widget. The problems are caused by
native libraries that are either not installed or the
wrong version in your particular flavor/install of Linux.

Symptoms include 
  - Blank Welcome page
  - New Dahsboard not working
  - JVM Crashes (when using internal web browser)
  
To rememedy do the following (works on Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't seem to work on 13.04)
  - Download XULRunner 10.0.2 (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/10.0.2/runtimes/) and unpack
  - Add the following arguments to STS.ini

-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<path-to-unpack-location>/xulrunner-10.0.2
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla

On Ubuntu 13.04 the best solution we found so far is to install the webkit-1.0 library explicitly

  sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0-0
  
  This works to a degree. Most notably users who also installed googletalk plugin (what you get when
  you install google hangout support) have experienced frequent JVM crashes... but it seems to
  work well as long as the google talk support is not installed.
